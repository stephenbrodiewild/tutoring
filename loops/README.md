# Loops + Iteration

For some background, theory etc take a look at loops.md

Exercises are in loops.py, some example code that's intended to be read + executed block-by-block (e.g. in VS Code) is in
common_loop_patterns.py, and loops_tests.py contains the
tests for loops.py.

Run tests:
```bash
python loops_tests.py
```
